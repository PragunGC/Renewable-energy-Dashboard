# Renewable-energy-Dashboard
An interactive dashboard using Panel and Hvplot for the Renewable Energy and Weather Conditions

This is a mini project I did for Data Visualizaton. It is an interactive dashboard created using Python libraries **Hvplot** and **Panel** and other necessary libraries.
## Dataset used:

Renewable Energy and Weather Conditions dataset from Kaggle
**Link:** [Dataset Link Here!](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samanemami/renewable-energy-and-weather-conditions)

## About Dashboard:
- Interactive and static plots are both present on this dashboard. Any plot with an accompanying widget is interactive, and those widgets are used to adjust the visualizations in accordance with user preferences. 
- The sidebar has dataset description taken from the Kabble website of the dataset, it also has a global widget for Time to set the time interval for attributes that are to be visualised. It also has a small spatial visualization that locates the Top 15 solar farms in the world as of now, which is also interactive.
